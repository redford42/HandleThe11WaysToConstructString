Liz walked out of the movie theater in a daze. The first movie she had been to see in over two years, and THIS is what happens?

The movie itself was spectacular. Comics had never really been Liz's thing, but she had seen the first Avengers movie at Tom's insistence, and she was on the edge of her seat the entire time. So¡­ when she happened to catch the tail end of the trailer for The Avengers: Age of Ultron, she made herself a promise that she would take the time to go see it, no matter what other things she had going on.

It did not disappoint.

The action was unbelievable, as she knew it would be. The moments of comedy were thrown in at all the right places, and there was even a bit of romance between two characters that she NEVER thought would be interested in each other. And then there was¡­Ultron. Ultron gave the movie something extra special. He was intriguing¡­maniacal¡­seductive¡­

Liz shook her head as she lumbered through the parking lot and found her car. She found the robot sexy. It was a sad situation, really. Some of the sexiest men in Hollywood strutting their stuff on the screen, and she was drooling over the robot. But what was REALLY getting to her was the reason she found him sexy. His voice was hypnotic, almost. Mechanical and sensual at the same time. He sounded like heaven.

He sounded like Red.

"You want me to go see a movie?"

Red's voice practically dripped with disbelief, and Liz could hardly believe it herself. There was a soft tapping over the phone and she wondered if he was tapping his hand on the table, a nervous habit she had tried not to notice. Was she making him nervous?

"Yes. Actually, I want you to go see a movie with me. Like¡­the two of us would go together." Every bit of the air in Liz's body seemed to escape at that very moment, severely impacting her ability to breathe. Should she have waited until The Avengers came out on DVD?
